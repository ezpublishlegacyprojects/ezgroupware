CodeSniffer

You can get CodeSniffer via PEAR

In order to use the eGroupWare Coding Standard, you should place a simlink in
/usr/share/php/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards pointing to the scripts/CodeSniffer directory:

cd /usr/share/php/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards
ln -s /path/to/scripts/CodeSniffer egw

After that you can run CodeSniffer on any file with
phpcs --standard=egw <filename>

Instead of filename you can also give a directoryname to check all files inside.
